The author of the original tenhou-english-ui plugin is retiring it, and this is its replacement.


Play Tenhou in the language of your choice!

This is the latest version of the Tenhou English UI, which updates the original plugin from Mai.

And use custom tilesets - labelled with Western numbers & letters, or brightened with stronger colours.

Available languages:
- English
- Français
- Tiếng Việt
- Polski

After installing this extension, head to http://tenhou.net/3/ to see the result.

Note: This will not work for the Flash client
